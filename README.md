# Simple Chat App – Frontend  

A lightweight chat application built with **React.js** and **Socket.io** for real-time communication with a server. This is an initial version with a basic design, and it can be expanded further with enhanced UI, authentication, and more features.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- Enter your **username** before joining the chat  
- Send and receive **real-time messages**  
- Scrolls automatically when new messages arrive  
- Simple and extendable UI  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Set Your Username**  
   - When you first load the app, you must enter a **username**.  
   - Once set, this username will be used for the entire session.  

2. **Start Chatting**  
   - After entering your username, you can send messages.  
   - Messages appear instantly, with different alignment based on the sender.  

3. **Backend Integration**  
   - The backend is built using **Strapi 5** and is deployed on Render.  
   - The backend URL: [`https://selfchat-backend.onrender.com`](https://selfchat-backend.onrender.com)  


# ⚠️ Important Notice

After starting the frontend, **please wait for at least 5 minutes** before attempting to use the chat. This delay ensures that the WebSocket server is fully initialized and ready for communication.

If the chat does not work immediately, please refresh the page and try again.

## 🛠 Future Improvements  
This is a basic version and can be enhanced with:  
- **User authentication** (Login & Signup)  
- **Better UI/UX** using Tailwind CSS or Material-UI  
- **Group chats & private messaging**  
- **Message persistence** using a database
